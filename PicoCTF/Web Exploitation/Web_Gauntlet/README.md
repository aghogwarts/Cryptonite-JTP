Visited the sites linked and checked out the filter for round 1 - apparently I cannot use `or` so I tried commenting the part after the common SQL injection with admin and put `admin' --` with random password and it worked. <br><br>

For round 2 I could not use `--` and `or` so I again commented with `/*` at the end `admin' /*` and it worked. <br><br>

For round 3 I could not comment it anymore so I looked up on common SQL injections and realised I could just terminate the SQL statement with `;` and used `admin' ;` which worked. <br><br>

Now things started to get a little tricky and I couldn't do anything with admin anymore so I looked up to find we can concatenate strings using `||` in SQL so I did just that `ad'||'min' ;` and then cleared the further rounds with this as well

Now after checking out the `filters.php` I find the flag finally!
