Saw the task the visited the site linked in the popup (used chrome for it which you'll understand why further). I then tried using Joe as username and random password which it doesn't seem to accept.

The hint definitely meant something so I tried using a random combo for username and password which it accepted I got in and it showed me a message saying no flag for you. As a common web exploitation protocol I inspected the site hehe and found out admin cookies for the site (which for some reason I couldn't see on Safari) and I tried changing it's value from `False` to `True` and it worked!
