# Bandit Task Week 01

[Youtube Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBf0hzazHTGOIn_vuuuCzRFVhYiDBnJID)

Walkthrough of my approach to this Task:

- Due to Bitlocker issues I had to uninstall Ubuntu Dual Boot from my Laptop
- And due to end sem prep I couldn't do the task except for watch the video and try to understand as much as I can. I have understood the implementation of the remaining file directory commands of string file types catenation and the other client commands like `ssh`, `openssl` etc.
- I haven't done the task but I will surely complete everything pending till date during my Semester Holidays from tomorrow
